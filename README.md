SUMMARY: This study introduces a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based system
designed to classify two common weld defects: overlap and spatter. To overcome the challenge of
limited data availability, we employed data augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset of welding
line images. The CNN architecture and hyperparameters were meticulously optimized for maximum
classification performance. Upon training the model, we integrated it into a user-friendly R Shiny web
application, enabling users to upload images, select regions of interest, and receive real-time defect
classifications (OK, Overlap, Spatter) for each section. Our proposed system demonstrates significant
potential for automated weld defect classification, paving the way for more efficient and reliable weld
quality assurance processes in industrial settings
